# Multi-Agent Path Planning Using A* Algorithm

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for implementing **Multi-Agent Path Planning** using the A* algorithm. It provides an effective solution for navigating multiple agents in a shared environment while avoiding collisions.

## Features

- Implementation of the A* algorithm for path planning.
- Multi-agent coordination for shared environments.
- Avoidance of agent collisions during path execution.
- Visualization of the paths for each agent.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python packages: `numpy`, `matplotlib`

You can install the necessary packages using:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
